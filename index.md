Introduction to R for non-programmers. This lesson set was prepared for Planning Code Camp at UCLA. 

The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code and best practices for using R for data analysis.

Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis.

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their usability.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Understand that computers store data and instructions (programs, scripts etc.) in files. Files are organised in directories (folders). Know how to access files not in the working directory by specifying the path.
